# Cracking-the-Coding-Interview-

Notes of Cracking-the-Coding-Interview  Book

I am not a recruiter. I am a software engineer. And as such, I know what it's like to be asked to whip up brilliant algorithms on the spot and then write flawless code on a whiteboard. I know because I've been asked
to do the same thing-in interviews at Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon, among other companies.

I also know because I've been on the other side of the table, asking candidates to do this. I've combed
through stacks of resumes to find the engineers who I thought might be able to actually pass these interviews. I've evaluated them as they solved-or tried to solve-challenging questions. And I've debated in Google's Hiring Committee whether a candidate did well enough to merit an offer. I understand the full
hiring circle because I've been through it all, repeatedly.

And you, reader, are probably preparing for an interview, perhaps tomorrow, next week, or next year. I am
here to help you solidify your understanding of computer science fundamentals and then learn how to
apply those fundamentals to crack the coding interview.
The 6th edition of Cracking the Coding Interview updates the 5th edition with 70% more content: additional
questions, revised solutions, new chapter introductions, more algorithm strategies, hints for all problems,
and other content. Be sure to check out our website, CrackingTheCodinglnterview.com, to connect with
other candidates and discover new resources.

I'm excited for you and for the skills you are going to develop. Thorough preparation will give you a wide
range of technical and communication skills. It will be well worth it, no matter where the effort takes you!
I encourage you to read these introductory chapters carefully. They contain important insight that just
might make the difference between a "hire" and a "no hire:'

And remember-interviews are hard! In my years of interviewing at Google, I saw some interviewers
ask "easy" questions while others ask harder questions. But you know what? Getting the easy questions
doesn't make it any easier to get the offer. Receiving an offer is not about solving questions flawlessly (very
few candidates do!). Rather, it is about answering questions better than other candidates. So don't stress out
when you get a tricky question-everyone else probably thought it was hard too. It's okay to not be flawless.
