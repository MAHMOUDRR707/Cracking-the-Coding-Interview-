# we have 2  methods  , first one to create large list and divide it to 3 parts
# Second method ..  The idea is to use two extra arrays for efficient implementation of k stacks in an array which is not mentioned in 
#quation becuase he need to implement it using only one array.

# The book solution works on the first approach I have mentioned but working to make the size of array flexible  ( which is already modified in python language)
